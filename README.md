# To-do
I made a pretty basic to-do list to learn the basics of JavaScipt. There are some simple features, like the option to show done task and the option to show when a task was made or marked as done. Tasks are saved in 'LocalStorage', so refreshing or closing the page won't make you lose data/tasks.
